Some simulations are not correct or have corrupted data
 In simulations2 :  1 (no wall after timestep 1) 
                    5 (no change in velocities and T is also 24.9 to 25.02) so this seems not working
                    27 seems to me changing but Rami find an issue                   

In simulation3 :    2 Overlap in AC and Obstacle (1 Obstacle  and 1 AC)
                    18 Overlap in ac0, obs0    (3 Obstacles and 1 AC)              
		    34 Overlap in ac0, obs1    (3 Obstacles and 1 AC)                    


Working simulations for me
In simulations2:  8   (1 Obstacle  and 1 AC) 
                  27  (1 Obstacle  and 1 AC)  (Rami say it has some issue)
		  31  (2 Obstacles and 1 AC)
		  33  (1 Obstacles and 1 AC)
             	  40  (2 Obstacles and 1 AC)
		  49  (3 Obstacles and 1 AC)


In simulation3:   21  (3 Obstacles and 1 AC)  
		  32  (1 Obstacle  and 1 AC)               
		  38  (2 Obstacles and 1 AC)
                  39  (1 Obstacle  and 1 AC)  
                  41  (1 Obstacle  and 1 AC)  
                  48  (1 Obstacle  and 1 AC)
