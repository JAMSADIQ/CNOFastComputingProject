Some simulations are not correct or have corrupted data
 In simulations2 :  1 (no wall after timestep 1) 
                    5 (no change in velocities and T is also 24.9 to 25.02) so this seems not working
In simulation3 :    2 Overlap in AC and Obstacle (1 Obstacle  and 1 AC)
                    18 Overlap in ac0, obs0    (3 Obstacles and 1 AC)              
                     

Working simulations
In simulations2:  8   (1 Obstacle  and 1 AC) 
                  27  (1 Obstacle  and 1 AC)
		  31  (2 Obstacles and 1 AC)
		  33  (1 Obstacles and 1 AC)
             	  40  (2 Obstacles and 1 AC)
		  49  (3 Obstacles and 1 AC)

In simulation3:   22  (3 Obstacles and 1 AC)
		  32  (1 Obstacle  and 1 AC)               
                  34  (3 Obstacles and 1 AC) (are one  obstacle and AC conflict with each other)

		  38  (2 Obstacles and 1 AC)
                  39  (1 Obstacle  and 1 AC)  
                  41  (1 Obstacle  and 1 AC)  
                  48  (1 Obstacle  and 1 AC)
